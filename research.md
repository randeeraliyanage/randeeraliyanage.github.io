Current Research Work:

- Wearable Edge Computing Device for Irregular Heart Condition Detection
  - This  research focuses on developing an innovative wearable edge computing device designed to detect irregular heart conditions in real time. Using the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and the MAX30102 pulse oximeter sensor, the device processes heart rate and blood oxygen levels with an accuracy of greater than 85%. The integration of TinyML enables efficient on-device data processing, ensuring real-time inferencing without reliance on external servers. Featuring wavelet-based signal processing and a compact, 3D-printed wearable design, the device is both practical and affordable. Current focus includes expanding the dataset for improved accuracy, integrating additional features such as fall detection, and optimizing power efficiency to support long-term use. This research aligns with my personal goal to make advanced health monitoring accessible for proactive personal healthcare.
