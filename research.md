- **Wearable Edge Computing Device for Irregular Heart Condition Detection**
  - Objective: Develop an affordable, real-time health monitoring solution for detecting irregular heart conditions.
  - This  research focuses on developing an innovative wearable edge computing device designed to detect irregular heart conditions in real time. Using the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and the MAX30102 pulse oximeter sensor, the device processes heart rate and blood oxygen levels with an accuracy of greater than 85%. The integration of TinyML enables efficient on-device data processing, ensuring real-time inferencing without reliance on external servers. Featuring wavelet-based signal processing and a compact, 3D-printed wearable design, the device is both practical and affordable. Current focus includes expanding the dataset for improved accuracy, integrating additional features such as fall detection, and optimizing power efficiency to support long-term use. 

- **Two-Wheeled Self-Balancing Robot Simulator for Distance Learning**
  - Objective: Provide an alternative platform for remote controls engineering experiments.
  - This research explores the development of a simulation-based platform for remote controls engineering experiments, using a two-wheeled self-balancing robot as the testbed. By combining advanced mathematical modeling, CAD simulations, and real-time control strategies like PID, LQR, and Kalman filtering, the study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting hands-on experiments without physical hardware. The simulation platform, developed in MATLAB SimScape, accurately mimics the dynamics of a physical prototype, providing students and researchers a cost-effective and flexible tool for distance learning. This approach paves the way for innovative remote education solutions, especially during times of restricted physical access to laboratories.
 
- **IoT-Enabled Portable Condition Monitoring Device**
  - Objective: Develop a cost-effective solution for industrial predictive maintenance through vibration and ambient condition monitoring.
  - This research presents an innovative IoT-enabled portable condition monitoring (CM) device designed for industrial predictive maintenance (PdM). The device integrates vibration analysis and environmental sensing to identify machine faults and monitor ambient conditions. Using cost-effective components like the ESP32 microcontroller and MPU6050 accelerometer, the device transmits data wirelessly via MQTT for offline analysis. Advanced signal processing techniques, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Hilbert Transform, and Envelope Spectrum Analysis, are employed to detect bearing faults with precision. The device serves as a proof-of-concept for scalable, multi-node CM systems, providing small-to-medium-scale industries with an affordable and effective alternative to traditional preventive maintenance tools.
