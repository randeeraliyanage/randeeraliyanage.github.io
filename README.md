# Hi there 👋, I am Randeera Liyanage
## Lecturer | Academic | Researcher in Mechatronics Engineering 

I am an academic, lecturer, and researcher in the field of mechatronics engineering. With a MEng (Hons) in Mechatronics Engineering from University Wolverhampton UK (First Class). Currently working as a Lecturer in Mechatronics Engineering at CINEC Campus Sri Lanka. I have a strong interest in embedded systems, applied electronics, control systems and robotics. Aside from lecturing, my work includes research, academic documentation and indrustry relations.

### Research Projects
#### Two-Wheeled Self-Balancing Robot
- This research focuses on non-linear control, real time parameter monitoring and balanced motion in an incline plane using the two wheeled self-balancing robot, developed as a simulation and prototype platform to conduct controls engineering experiments for undergraduates.
- Current work in this research includes optimization of the platform, balancing performance on in-clined planes uand manuvarability using PID control.
- Future research will focus on the implementation and performance evaluation of optimal and robust control stratergies. Implementation of Kalman filtering to the platform and the evaluation of positive/ negative effects on the robot's performance is another aspect of future research.

#### Micro Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)
