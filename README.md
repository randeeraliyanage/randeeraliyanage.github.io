### Research Projects
#### Two-Wheeled Self-Balancing Robot
- This research focuses on non-linear control, real time parameter monitoring and balanced motion in an incline plane using the two wheeled self-balancing robot, developed as a simulation and prototype platform to conduct controls engineering experiments for undergraduates.
- Current work in this research includes optimization of the platform, balancing performance on incline planes and maneuverability using PID control.
- Future research will focus on the implementation and performance evaluation of optimal and robust control strategies. Implementation of Kalman filtering to the platform and the evaluation of positive/ negative effects on the robot's performance is another aspect of future research.

#### Micro Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)
- This research originated from the common difficulties encountered in developing a low cost underwater robot suitable for underwater inspections. The Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) in this research is a micro sized with a payload capacity of less than 1kg. The chassis is a completely new design which was optimized using fluid dynamic simulations. The micro size allows the robot to be used in rapid maneuvering tasks under tight spaces, which is suitable for underwater explorations such as coral reefs and shipwrecks.
- Current research focuses on the development of the custom AUV chassis and the integration of all the electronics in a single PCB. The testing will be carried out on basic maneuvering tasks underwater using a ground controller.
- Future research will focus on the implementation of a suitable control scheme such as PID to achieve a better system response and understanding the effects of nonlinear dynamics and the methods to overcome them.

#### Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) Platform 
- The world of manufacturing will be fully autonomous before you know it. The center of it all lies on a versite robot known as the Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV). Engineers today must have the required hands on experience for the future. Though educational AGV platforms are available, they are often expensive, limited to a specific application and generally, closed systems. This research focuses on the development of a re-configurable low cost AGV platform to be used in undergraduate education.
- The current research focuses on the development of a re-configurable custom platform, integrating the essential electronics in a PCB and having modular slots for sensors/ actuators which will suit multiple applications. This will also enable the undergraduates to experiment with multiple sensors/ actuators and program the robot for multiple scenarios.
- Future research will mainly focus on the implementation of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping through ROS. This will open up the AGV platform to multiple experiments and optimizations for a variety of dynamic environments. It will also help to observe the performance and limitations of utilizing an AGV for a given task.
